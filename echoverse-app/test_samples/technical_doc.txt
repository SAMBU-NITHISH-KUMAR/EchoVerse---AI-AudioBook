Machine learning algorithms require large datasets for training to achieve optimal performance. The quality and diversity of training data directly impacts model accuracy and generalization capabilities. Data preprocessing steps include cleaning, normalization, and feature selection. Hyperparameter tuning involves adjusting learning rates, batch sizes, and network architectures. Cross-validation techniques help prevent overfitting and ensure robust model performance. Regular evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score provide insights into model effectiveness across different use cases.
